	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it takes less time to execute for large inputs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run. It is usually expressed in terms of the input size, such as O(n). Optimizing algorithms for better Space Complexity ensures they use memory resources effectively.
